# Diabetes-Prediction

## Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body is unable to effectively use the insulin it produces, leading to high blood sugar levels. Early prediction of diabetes can help in taking preventive measures and managing the condition more effectively. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on their medical attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains the following features:
- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age`: Age (years)
- `Outcome`: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating if the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)

## Project Objective
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical attributes.
